# Learnt

A minimal iOS app for tracking daily learnings.

## Philosophy

> Every element must earn its place. If removing something makes the app clearer, cut it.

## Features

- **Multiple entries per day** - Capture learnings whenever they happen
- **Voice or text input** - Capture thoughts however feels natural
- **Spaced repetition** - Review at optimal intervals for long-term retention
- **Weekly activity dots** - See your consistency at a glance
- **Monthly summaries** - Track your learning journey with "Your Month"
